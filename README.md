## Introduction

This project is a data analysis and heatmap generation tool for real estate properties in the Wellington region. It can help you find the most suitable properties in the Wellington area by analyzing real estate information and generating heatmaps to make informed decisions when purchasing a property.

## Purpose

I developed this code to assist in real estate data analysis and property searching in the Wellington region. After successfully purchasing a property, I no longer have a use for this tool. Therefore, I decided to organize the code and share it on GitHub for others who are interested in real estate in the Wellington area to use.

## Features and Highlights

Here are the main features and highlights of this tool:

1. Property Data Retrieval: Fetches real estate data for the Wellington area by sending a POST request to the server, including properties for sale and off-market properties.

2. Multi-Threading: Utilizes multi-threading techniques to efficiently process a large volume of real estate data and improve data processing speed.

3. Data Cleaning and Structuring: Cleans and processes the raw real estate data into a structured format for easier analysis.

4. Heatmap Generation: Generates a heatmap based on the real estate data, visually displaying the distribution of properties and their price levels in the Wellington area.

5. Map Visualization: Embeds the generated heatmap into a map using the Folium library for easy visualization of property distribution and pricing.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the tool:

1. Install Dependencies: Ensure that Python and the required third-party libraries (requests, json, folium, etc.) are installed on your computer.

2. Get the Code: Clone this project's code from GitHub to your local machine.

3. Run the Program: Run the main program file in the command-line interface to start fetching real estate data and generating the heatmap.

4. View the Result: The generated heatmap will be saved as an HTML file. You can open this file in your browser to view the real estate heatmap for the Wellington area.

## Important Notes

1. Please be aware that the process of fetching real estate data may take some time, depending on server response speed and data volume.

2. Respect server access limits and avoid excessive requests to prevent server overload.
